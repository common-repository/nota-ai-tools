Nota’s assistive AI tools help publishers create headlines, summaries, SEO keywords and more.

== Description ==

Nota is a SaaS company building AI-enabled tools to streamline content creation and distribution. Their assistive AI tools help publishers, marketers and content creators generate headlines, summaries, SEO keywords and more.  

Nota is taking the pain points out of the content creation process so you can focus on what really matters: your story.

== Dissect Content with Speed. ==

The Nota plugin is a time-saving tool for editorial, marketing and content teams focused on optimizations—generating headlines, summaries, top quotes, key points, SEO keywords and categories. The plugin utilizes large language models to generate AI responses, returning robust copy results. 

Nota runs text through uber-powerful AI and ML tools to break down all that content into workable outputs. No prompts or queries, no AI learning curves, just quick-and-easy text applications. Analyze a post and tailor the outputs for more, less or just different results with the push of a button. If you’re looking for a human touch, you can edit the outputs directly to your liking. 

== Installation ==

This is a beta tool that requires paid account access. [Click here](https://share.hsforms.com/1nAzyMRnWRmiTa34N1fynBAedloz) to contact Nota about creating your account before proceeding with the steps below. 

1. Download and activate the Nota AI Tools plugin from this page or from your WordPress instance.
2. Because Nota tools are still in beta, you’ll need paid access to the toolset outside of WordPress. You can fill out [the form here](https://share.hsforms.com/1nAzyMRnWRmiTa34N1fynBAedloz) to start your setup process. 
3. Once you’re set up in the tools, you’ll need an API key to authorize your WordPress plugin. More instructions on how to access your API key [may be found here](https://help.heynota.com/wordpress-nota-plugin-install-how-to).
